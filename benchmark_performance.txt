Overview
Our solution addresses the Kaggle Question Answering task, focusing on long answer identification and short answer extraction. We build separate models for each task and combine them.

Techniques Used
- data preprocessing
- tokenization and embedding
- classification model designed to predict the correctness of long answer candidates
- model that predicts the start and end indices of short answers
- evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score
- submission: .csv file containing predicted long and short answer tokens for submission

For detailed implementation and results, refer to the comprehensive report.
